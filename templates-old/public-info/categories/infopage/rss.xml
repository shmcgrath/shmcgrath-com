          <description xml:base="https://shmcgrath.com/about/">&lt;p&gt;I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA and am currently a Senior IT Business Analyst at Evoqua.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am interested in working on the back end of systems, using Python, C#, and COBOL. I took two semesters of COBOL during grad school and enjoy writing the language. I am gaining experience using SSIS to interact with systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coding in my free time, I typically use Python. I have a couple of one shot scripts on GitHub and am working on a package that would move saved URLs between various websites. Most of my Python work is done in Vim &#x2F; the terminal and my dotfiles are also on GitHub.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my free time I like to watch sports, read, and play video games. I have built several &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olkb.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;OLKBs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (ortho-linear keyboards) and tinker with running various services on my Arch Linux powered server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
